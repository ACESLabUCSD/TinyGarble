This directory consists of a gate library and 7 applications:

1) AES (c=10)
2) Compare (Millionaire's problem) (w=16384, c=16384)
3) Hamming Distance (w=16000, c=16000)
4) RSA (w=1024, n=2097152)
5) SHA3 (c=24)
6) Stack Machine (w=32, c= depends on instruction length)
7) Sum (w=262144, c=262144)

c is the number of sequential cycles that the circuit should be evaluated.
w is the bit width of the inputs.


The functionality of elements are describe in the library file (dff.lib).

-DFF is a D-Flip Flop where D is the input, Q is the output, I is the initial value (CLK and RST are only used for simulation not for the garbling/evaluation).
